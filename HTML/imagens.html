    Subject: What would you like to see most in minix?<br>
    Summary: small poll for my new operating system<br>

    <br>
    &quot;Hello everybody out there using minix –<br>
    <br>
    I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and
    professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing
    since april, and is starting to get ready. I’d like any feedback on
    things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat
    (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)
    among other things).<br>
    <br>
    I’ve currently ported bash(1.08) &amp; gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.
    This implies that I’ll get something practical within a few months, and
    I’d like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions
    are welcome, but I won’t promise I’ll implement them&nbsp;:-) <br>
    <br>

    PS. Yes – it’s free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.
    It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never
    will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that’s all I have&nbsp;:-(.&quot;<br>
